### Problem Statement
   - A company wishes to add user control for product categories for the customers to choose a category and view the trend month-by-month and product-by-product.
   - They wants to use Excel to analyze sales based on product categories and create a sales dashboard that breaks down sales by product category.
   - They also wanted us to Calculate the predicted and actual tip values and the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of the model.

### Tasks Performed
   - The various tasks that I had done on the dataset using Excel are as follows:
     1. Used the saved sample e-commerce database.
     2. Created a Histogram for shipping days(aging).
     3. Prepared a table of sales and profit month-wise in the working sheet.
     4. Prepared the sales table region-wise in the working sheet.
     5. Created a user control combo box for the product category.
     6. Created a column chart of the month-wise table and region-wise table.
     7. Linked the table with a combo box.
     8. Created a dashboard and calculated the predicted and actual tip values.
     9. Calculated the RMSE (Root mean square error) of the model.
